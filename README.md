# Whatsapp-Msg-TimeGap
EXPERIMENT 1

Observe the time gaps between your next 30 WhatsApp messages.
Plot a histogram of your data using MATLAB.
Fit a density function on to your data, by using the appropriate MATLAB tools.
Based on your distribution, find the probability that the time elapsed until your next message is less than the expected time gap.

EXPERIMENT 2

Repeat Experiment 1, but this time, record the time gaps between messages from one person - a person you communicate with sufficiently often.

NOTE : Do the following for both experiments:
Observe the time gaps between the next 10 messages you receive. If a time gap is less than the expected time gap, mark the observation as a Heads, otherwise as Tails. 
Record the number of Heads and Tails
