# Whatsapp-Msg-TimeGap
Conducetd two experiments on Whatsapp messages and plotted it using MATLAB!

Experiment 1: Observe the time gaps between your next 30 WhatsApp messages. and Plot a histogram of your data using MATLAB. Fit a density function on to your data. Based on your distribution, find the probability that the time elapsed until your next message is less than the expected time gap.

Experiment 2: Repeat Experiment 1, but this time, record the time gaps between messages from one person - a person you communicate with sufficiently often.

Note : Do the following for both experiments:
Observe the time gaps between the next 10 messages you receive. If a time gap is less than the expected time gap, mark the observation as a Heads, otherwise as Tails. Record and print the number of Heads and Tails
